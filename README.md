In the main menu we can order any kind of pizza. With the "kilistáz" will be shown all the product which you want to buy. If you want to delete your order click to the "töröl" button. Before the order click to the kilistáz button then click to the "rendel" button. All the product which was ordered automatically will be written in a file(called hello1.txt). If you click to the "adminisztráció", button you can see the ongoing orders.

Run:
1. Download the folder
2. Open Pizza Java class
3. Click to the run button
